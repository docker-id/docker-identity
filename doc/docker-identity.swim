= Description

*Docker Identity* is a project to make Docker containers identify themselves.
ie Declare what they do, how they do it, and how they are configured / run.

The `did` command can run container images that meet this contract, ensuring
that they are run according to spec.

= Git Repository Branches

All of the resources of the Docker Identity project are in this repository, but
on separate, unrelated branches. The important branches are:

- `did`

  The `did` CLI command. This command is a companion to the `docker` CLI
  command itself.

- `dids`

  A set of build command for sample indentity aware containers.

- `spec`

  The Docker Identity specification. Describes the domain of the Identity
  project, and defines the `identity.yml` data structures that provide
  identity.

- `web/info`

  Source code for the https://info.dockerid.com website.
